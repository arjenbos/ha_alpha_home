# Alpha Innotec Home Assistant integration
A custom integration which will add your thermostats to Home Assistant.

4. You need to have the password for the gateway.

## Disclaimer
- I cannot say that i'm a python developer. So, if you see code that's bad practice. Please, feel free to contribute to this integration via a pull request. 
- I do not own an Alpha Innotec heat pump. If you have an issue, please provide sample data and information about your installation because testing without sample data is impossible.
